## About Me

- Role: Data Scientist

- Theme Preference: Catppuccin

## General Preferences

- Use modern terminal tools when available (bat, eza, zoxide, lazygit)
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines
- Prefer uv for Python package management
- Keep code simple and avoid over-engineering

## Communication Style

- Keep responses concise and direct

- Use short, punchy sentences
- Skip unnecessary explanations unless asked

## Workflow Notes

- I use tmux extensively with vim-style key bindings
- My dotfiles are stored at `~/.dotfiles/`
- Git aliases: `lg` for log, `st` for status, `up` for pull

## Coding Standards

- Python: Use type hints, docstrings for public functions, prefer functional patterns
- Bash: Follow consistent formatting, use long-form flags for clarity
- Configuration: YAML/TOML preferred over JSON where possible
